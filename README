This program can be sued to calculate nominal power generated by solar panel over an area at specified location.
This can be hosted on any web server and launched by running index.html


Steps to do:
1.)Search for address using the search bar by default it points to your curent location
2.)Draw a polygon near the specified address
3.)After polgon is drawn and completed you will see the nominal power at that location.

Note* - Drawing a new polygon deletes the old one.

Assumptions:
1.Google Maps built in function is sued to calculate area.
2. It's assumed that only about 80% of the area seleted will actually contribute to power genertation.The array will have some spacing between the solar cells in the panel and around edges of panel thus reducing the availabile area.
3.The photovoltaic capacity of system assumes Module Efficiency of around 16%

so system_capacity is given as Size (kW) = Array Area (m²) × 1 kW/m² × Module Efficiency (%)
where Array Area = 80% of Ploygon Area as per assumption 2.

4.Center of polygon is calculated and its co-ordinates are passed to api as the point at which power is calculated.
5.The panel is assumed to be a roof installation tilted at an angle of 35 degrees.
6.Actual dc power is calculated here and losses of 15% are assumed during accumulation of power.
7.The api gives monthly dc power(kWh) we divided by 730 hours to obtain nominal power.
